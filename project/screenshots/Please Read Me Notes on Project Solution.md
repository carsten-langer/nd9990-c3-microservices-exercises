I found the project description confusing.
On the one hand it states "Please upload your screenshots to the existing directory named screenshots in the starter project."
This implies I would have to use a fork of the nd9990-c3-microservices-exercises repository. 
On the other hand breaking down a monolith into microservices in my opinion comes with braking it up into several project.

Thus I include the requested screenshots into a fork of the original repository at
https://github.com/carsten-langer/nd9990-c3-microservices-exercises/tree/master/project/screenshots

However, the refactored microservices are stored at:
- https://github.com/carsten-langer/cloud-developer-microservices-frontend
- https://github.com/carsten-langer/cloud-developer-microservices-api-user
- https://github.com/carsten-langer/cloud-developer-microservices-api-feed
- https://github.com/carsten-langer/cloud-developer-microservices-deployment
